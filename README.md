# Topic-Modelling

## Background
In today's world people love to leave feedbacks about the products and services in multiple channels like social media platforms, product websites, merchant websites etc. Companies have to constantly monitor user rating and comments to protect themselves. At the same time smart companies leverages these comments as sources for improvement.

While I was trying to work on the comments people leave apps in from App store I wanted to see what more I can apply to suer commnets apart from sentimental analysis. Can I quickly sort through the comments and find our the topics people are appreciating, or dissatisfied with. In my search I came across this brilliant blog https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/ on Topic modelling.
