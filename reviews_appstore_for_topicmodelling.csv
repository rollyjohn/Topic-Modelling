The deletion option does not allow the account holder to select more thank one payee account for deletion. One is required to fill in the numbers from the grid on the reverse the debit card to confirm the deletion then why not allow multiple accounts to be selected. Because if one has more than one account to delete then one has to delete one by one and after each deletion one has to again scroll through the entire list of payees to select the next one for deletion. It would have been simple if one is allowed to select multiple accounts for deletion at one go. Is there any issue on providing this feature? To ensure that there isn't an incorrect deletion there could be a provision to provide a preview of accounts selected to delete and edit/modify if there is an incorrect entry.,5,2021-12-31 09:34:14
"Same issue repeats - credit card tab not working especially for Sapphiro Amex cards. I can not ‘manage’ Amex cards as the app getting struck. The same old issue repeats again. ICICI FasTags are sometimes shown/displayed in app’s Home Screen on top but they are NOT shown other times. Clearly a bug. Link and show ICICI pre-paid meal card, fuel card, multi-Wallet cards into iMobile App itself. Temporary blocking of DEBIT card is not at all good. Temporary blocking and unblocking of debit card should be similar to credit card. Option to block or unblock of CREDT card is very good. Same user interface should be applied for DEBIT card also. Existing corporate NPS account held with ICICI shall be shown along with total contribution and value. NPS shall be shown on top of the home screen similar to account balance and credit card due. Investment section needs lots of improvement, it is currently not user friendly not showing many details, please improve investment section with portfolios, values and graphics and bar charts like Paytm Money Thanks.",2,2021-04-05 12:14:51
"1. The app could do with a serious makeover also ensuring that all the functionality still works. Like never have I been able to successfully close an iWish from phone. And the error has always been non descriptive.

2. When you login, they keep showing you stupid prompts for loans and such. These just won’t stop. And there is no option to “Never show me again”. The only options are “I’m interested” and “Remind me later”. And guess what… they will remind you at every single login. And god forbid, if someone accidentally does tap on their spammy banners, customer care will make your life living hell by calling you continuously at odd hours and will not listen to you when you tell them YOU DONT NEED A LOAN and they will just keep calling you till the day you die. You can’t block them because they call from a new number every time.

3. If a consumer is using an app on an iOS device, there are some implicit benchmarks iOS apps should try to achieve. But no. ICICI will create an app that doesn’t utilise iOS framework and do its own thing and make a stupid good for nothing app.",1,2022-01-01 03:31:08
"Hello...all other banks like sbi RBL etc have provided the facility to directly pay their credit card bills via their app via internet banking or debit card payment from other banks even if you don’t have a savings account or checking account with them and the payment gets credited to the credit card immediately but your app has not implemented any such facility always we have to use the click2pay feature and have to wait for 3 business days for the amount to get credited to the credit card and if there is any holiday we have to wait for more than 3 business days since we don’t have any savings or checking account with you in order to pay directly ....
Please try to implement the feature of paying the credit card bill directly via the app using the net banking or debit card payments from other banks...
Your app just provides only the basic information such as due amount statement that’s it..,
Hope u will improve ur app with more features in the future upgrades...",1,2018-12-27 15:37:22
"The update has a great new User Interface. Love the new Analytics feature called  “Discover” introduced which gives you a spending overview, expense timeline, upcoming scheduled expenses, status of service requests.
What I loved the most was the Cashflow Analysis and estimated budget analysis explained by colourful bar graphs. Its like having my personal Excel sheet of expenses which summarises my expenses for me in all kinds if ways.
There is also a Knowledge Horizon section, which gives you really helpful tips on saving money, taking insurances and others..
Happy to see that ICICI has taken a step ahead and gone beyond conventional banking practices by introducing features which not only help you transact your money, but also advices you to manage and save it well. A job neatly done!",5,2018-12-24 09:26:27
"I like to set limits for all transactions just because I do not get overboard with spends. Before the previous update I was able to do that just fine, however lately I am unable to set a limit of my choice. Once I set the limits and click on submit a pop-up comes up stating the limit should be between 100 and X amount and limits applied, however once I roll back to previous menu and go to limits section again, the limits are set back to default. Why on earth would anyone give an option to set limit if a customer is limited by a stupid app. 
Adding more to this I am having payments for my apple subscriptions getting declined and me updating my payment details in app store over and over again due to this bug in your app. 
Get it resolved or be ready for a complaint with RBI as this is cheating in terms of service with the customer. By not allowing a user to set desired limit you’re exposing their liability in case of any fraud.",1,2021-10-17 22:54:39
"New version upgrade to 6.0 is a disaster. App allows to login beyond which the application stops working. Reason being a pop up Apply Now comes up, which cannot be by passed. This version does not have location services, however the options in the pop up pages loops in insisting on pop up. Entire mobile banking experience has come to a stand still. This needs an immediate fix, considering the current social distancing requirement. Can’t the developers test the application before release?

I had to upgrade bcos, the fund transfer feature was hanging. I don’t think even that would be fixed. Application needs complete assessment and rethink",5,2020-10-03 18:38:32

"This App Lacks So Many Things, For Starters Let's Just Talk About UI/UX Which Is Really Really Bad. This App Takes 5-6 Seconds Before You Could Log In, Secondly This App Is Partly Compatible With iPhone Devices Having Notch Display. Sometimes The Fonts Are Too Big, The Time Is Half Visible While Usig The App On Top Of Phone Screen. Now, If We Talk About The Features This App Lacks The Basic Things Like You Can't See Unbilled Transaction ( Which Hasn't Been Settled Yet) Suppose You Make A Payment Using Your Credit Card That Transaction Takes At Least 3 Days Before It Can Be Displayed On App. Other Than That Non-ICICI Bank Customers Who Use This App For Their Credit Card They Can't Pay Their Bill, The Pay Bill Option Doesn't Work For Non-ICICI Saving Account Holder. If Suppose You Have Made A Payment Of Your Credit Card Using Third Party App, There Is No Way You Can Check Your Payment History In App. I Think ICICI Bank Should Invest More Money In IT Sector And Improve Everything That's Wrong With This App.",1,2020-02-05 15:56:50
"I really liked ICCI mobile banking application. It has various features of enjoying banking benefits being anywhere &  interface oh this app is also too good!

Only thing which i want to advice is please give a review of payback points earned by icci debit / credit card.  You should be showing analysis of how many points ( payback ) earned on how much amount of transaction on which shop or retailer or any purchase!   It’s something similar how axis bank show their axis edge rewards earned by their customers  on which transaction & how much points under.  Points transaction menu!

The visual analytics is making a ton of difference which allows the user to explore and retains interest in continuing to use the app. Ease of use has increased tremendously in recent times. This app is no less than some of the best International finance/banking apps. Thank you ICICI Bank, Happy to be your customer! Keep it up.",5,2021-12-07 04:53:36
"Im using many credit cards. Recently received icici credit card and dowloaded this app. For login it requires registered mobile number . I have opened website in that it is mentioned that mobile number may be registered through ICICI ATM. I went to ATM and tried it is asking from card Pin. I dont have pin. So i went back to home and tried for pin. I have generated 3 d secure pin. Then again I tried in Atm. Again negative. I needs card pin and the only option is visiting the bank. 
Now please explain, did ICICI credit card service people, do u people have brains? If u dont believe our mobile number, why u guys calling us asking to apply for credit card. IF OTP from our mobile is not sufficient then dont call us waste our time. Is visiting ur bank that much necessary in these pandemic days?

"Easily miles ahead of many other bank apps in navigation, features, etc., except for one hitch in the app. The equity prices of the portfolio in the Demat section (in a 3 in 1 account) does not get updated even on a delayed basis during the day!! This has been the status for almost 2 years now. I have complained many times about this but to no avail, despite being a private banking client. It is a big irritant, if the equity prices do not get updated even on a delayed basis, if not in real time, especially when markets are volatile. The situation is such that sometimes the price updates do not happen, even once a day!! Other than this big irritant, the app is a gem.",4,2021-07-28 13:36:38
"Team - I am on latest ios and using my iPhone 6s. I used to like the icici app, but the current design lacks user friendliness. The account and credit card summary boxes on top show overlapping and truncated texts. The credit card summary doesn’t show my current pending amount or my balance. What use is that for any user? These are UI design flaws.  I have emailed the icici mobile team with screenshots quite sometime back, but dont see and responses. I hope the team makes necessary changes soon.",5,2020-02-04 04:26:01
"They force for demat account and provide instantly through complete online process. You will not get the same response for closing and it’s complete manual process and they try their level best to frustrate the customer. Without closing of demat account, you can’t close main account. So please don’t go for ICICI demat account.

Following are communication outcomes with customer care in a span of three months and still demat account was not closed,

1) To close the savings account, demat account should be closed.
2) Demat account can be opened online but can’t be closed by means of online.
3) Mail communication sufficient to close the demat account.
4) After giving the mail got the response like, Demat account can’t be closed through mail, account closure form should be submitted.
5) After submitting the demat account closure form, they asked for pan scan copy.
6) After giving the pan copy along with demat account closure form, they saying that mail id was not registered with the account.

"I have experienced an issue while trying to install the latest version where it asks for activation of the app every time. The reason being, we can select an mpin option or internet banking password option while installing the app, but if we select the check box of Use Touch ID, the real issue happens. For the first time it will allow us to login, but from second time on wards, the application will ask for activation again which is the problem. So to avoid this, choose only one option of use mpin or internet banking password or Touch ID, but do not mix two options like mpin and Touch ID.

However, there’s an interface issue with the home page of 7.9 version of the app. There is text and border alignment issue as the details on the right side of the screen gets hidden, or not displayed properly. That needs to be fixed. 
Also, the bill payment option is limited to certain banks only; I never find the bank which I use to repay the bills. The app should include all the major banks at least (whether public or private) to make the bill repayment easier.",3,2021-09-28 11:30:43

"There are various bugs in the application (which may be specific to my case only). Some of them are mentioned below.

1. After logging in, the first screen should contain the savings account details, but it doesn’t show. I can only see my two credit cards at the top.

2. UPI icon is not available on the home screen or in anywhere in the menu. I could find it though using the HELP. The UPI icon should be available in the home screen itself just like in the screenshots given in the app description. I don’t know why it is not appearing on my home tab.

3. The application interface is not accurately compatible with the screens of iPhone X and above models. The interface get cut sometimes due to the screen incompatibility issue.

4. The application hangs very frequently.

5. Sometimes we go into the some menu and there’s no back button (no back slide also), so due to that we can’t go back and we have to forcefully close the application and restart the application. This creates the whole process cumbersome.

I am sure there are many more issues which I am unable to recall at this moment.",1,2021-06-06 10:58:51
Worst app and bad customer support. Response or solution is not given. I have installed pocket app some years ago. Recently I had my salaried account in Icici. Now they are not able to add my phone number because of the unused pocket app. I cannot use my atm card for online service and my internet banking is also not working. Customer care is denying to delete  pockets app. They  are suggesting to change my salary account to different bank or I should purchase a different sim or phone number. Such a great bank is Icici. The app doesn’t show any closure of pockets account. Customer care and bank employees could not locate where is closing link. But they say I should close from my mobile only. I am planning close my salaried account if the issue will not be resolved in a week.,1,2018-11-30 17:15:04
"Indeed, new updated version looks really good however I am bit concerned about the verification of mobile number again if the no mobile range is available e.g. in my house there is no coverage for Airtel but I do have Wifi.

I am using IMobile for past 8 years never had this kind of worst experience but this is absurd that the application says “seems like SIM card not present in mobile for security reasons reactivate” . Why should I activate it again and again.? How does this app know that I don’t have SIM card in my mobile. When I am at my I won’t be having mobile network. So how your app will check whether SIM card is there or not ? If there is no network coverage your app assumes that there is no sim card. How smart the developers team. So if I am in a no network area and if I have internet access I cannot do transaction ? That is ridiculous. Please fix the bug. this is really bad which is frustrating.,1,2021-06-01 02:26:34

The revamped UI is great but the reason for giving its one star is that every-time you open the app when there is no mobile network in your phone is asks to activate it again.

"Some of the tabs On iOS app doesn't have a way to go back to the previous tab. Gestures don't work. There is a back arrow on top left side but it overlaps with the search box so touching it only takes back to search option. If the app is minimized partially, back arrow becomes visible fully but touching it does nothing. Only way to go back to the previous tab is to close the app and re login. This was a common issue on apps that were released couple of years ago when gesture navigation was catching up.

Please immediately fire this app’s developers and before that entire QA TEAM.

Please find below FEATURES your team introduced:

1. Wahiyaaat tab’s navigation while go to add billers.
2. Somehow if user figured out how to delete existing biller then as soon as you delete app shows toooooo many alerts with PLEASE SELECT BILLER TO DELET.

5. If you do little bit navigation in the app and then come back to home page, try to navigate on services or other options app always sending me to the previous page i was before home page.

"For a few minutes after opening the app I was actually worried that I’d download some kind of fake app that was trying to get my sensitive personal information because the UI of this app is SO BAD that I could not believe an actual legit bank has spent money on developing this. There are so many display issues and every time I try to open the credit card section it takes me into the loan section. Worst of all I literally have to wait 5 seconds after opening the app to log in. After using the Kotak and SBI apps, I’m left wondering how a bank with your repute can afford to have such a crappy clunky app. Please fire your iOS developer and get a real one.",1,2020-10-05 18:56:06

"Used to work before. Nowadays it’s horrible. After the last update the bug where the login state kept resetting is fixed. But now, it doesn’t remember my UPI VPAs. So I cannot make any transactions using UPI because of this. To make a transaction I have to create a new VPA and it will show the older VPAs only after that. Since I’m a techie I’m guessing that the devs are setting a flag to retrieve VPAs after first VPA is set. Instead of doing this just do a select count in the VPA table to get count of VPAs stored and then show the appropriate UI based on whether the count is zero or more rather than using a flag variable! That would fix this bug. Hope that you fix this issue soon.",2,2018-02-20 13:45:58

"I lost my regular handset which had iMobile app and now using a temporary one until I buy a new one. 

I have a jio sim and this temporary handset (iPhone 5s) is a non-Volte handset for which I have to download “jio4g voice” app to be able to use jio sim. This jio4g voice app itself becomes default sms and voice calling app.  

Your iMobile app while verifying my mobile no. sends pre-defined sms through iPhone’s SMS app which does not work when “jio4g voice” app is installed as it becomes default sms app resulting into verification failed status. So I am unable to install iMobile app. 

Apple and Jio both prominent players in their fields, you should take this possibility into consideration and should have developed your app accordingly. This probably may be leaving hundreds of thousands of customers depriving them off installing iMobile.",4,2020-01-16 09:46:08
"I would have totally given 5-star rating few weeks ago. But recently I moved to iPhone 12 and started seeing bunch of issues -
1. Loan section of app doesn’t work. First time it shows some random credit card and personal loan static links. When I try 2nd/3rd time it shows my linked home loan account. Now when I open it, view is completely distorted, I can’t see anything clearly + links doesn’t work either.

2. Small but little annoying - top account summary card style is little messed up

3. It doesn’t let me submit the feedback once I logout from app.

I’m sure you guys are putting a lot of effort to enhance your digital presence. I would say ICICI mobile app is providing the experience at par with some of the international banks. Kudos to the team.

"Hi,

Thank you for getting the banking on our fingertips. It really makes easy for handling our banking.

Why I’m giving 3 star is because of 2 major issues that I face much frequently.
1) Whenever I enter pin, many times it shows spinner and then vanishes but it doesn’t log me in. I have to reopen the app and then it works. 

2) When I try to see my statement, as soon as I click on Statement tab, it gives an alert saying some error occurred and there is an Okay button. As soon as I click the okay button, it just shows a whole screen. In such cases, I have to close the app, reopen and religion and try again. This issue is much frequent. I’ve checked on WiFi with 10 MBPS as well as datapack. 

Both issues are annoying. 

Please have a look!

Looking forward to hearing back !",3,2020-06-10 05:04:05

The helpline no mentioned is for general banking services. I have the account associated no in my iPhone and no other line active still it would never verify. I have hopelessly tried for 1 month and eventually gave up. Decided it was better to use desktop that trying to activate the app every day. I wish Apple has a zero star or negative star rating so I could give it to the app. Even a negative marking is a bit lenient for the agony this app gives.,1,2020-03-01 06:29:43
Worst app by adding more and more features and killing basic speed and user registration. My account got automatically de activated and now not able to register back.

And then after sending mail forget it. What you make icici team developers?? Keep it simple it will make more beneficial and helpful for customer. Keep on adding things will make unstable. Below poor rating to Devloper head who didn’t upgrade hardware,1,2019-05-24 12:45:27
"I fail to understand the rationale of having to activate the app regularly every few days. The SMS verification is not working post update. One can be on wifi or off wifi. One can shut off iMessage also but even then the verification is not working.

Hope the developer tests before going live with any development.",5,2020-10-16 11:23:32
"I have been using iMobile for last few years and it made life lot simpler.  It did had glitches initially,  but much better and much matured.  Initially I stopped going to banks using online system,  no I stopped going to system also.. if some features can be added towards premium customers like the privelage support,  it would be good.

"This app was best banking app. But now days it's too slow. Lots of time cards are not loaded and requires multiple time login log outs.
My question is why you have added so many features that is not required daily banking. you can create a special app for your products.
So disappointed.
I am thinking to delete this app sooner. now days its a useless app.",5,2019-10-04 02:48:43
"I love this app and the way UI is made , its look and feel and all the features which a customer needs are available . some best features i like are outstanding balance in one click, login with thumb print, international transactions can be enabled or disabled which i usually disable as there are most of cyber frauds outside india",5,2021-02-08 16:32:58
"There is a bug on registration page. You cannot just activate ur account. When I tried to activate it, it showed some weird error messages like “internet not connected” even when my phone has internet connection. Moreover, when the timer ran down to 0. The pop up was still there and kept on showing the loading gif. I didn’t expect this level of bugs from ICICI like bank. What would be worst than ur customers not at all being able to use the app. Learn from kotak, do away with ur web view app and do some real native stuff",2,2019-08-25 06:43:20

"So after yesterday’s update i lost the device registration. I am happy to reactivate it however what was more annoying was the reason icici gave. 

On the first launch of the app after update the error was “activation failed - as you have activated on another device” are you all kidding me this error is scary and dangerous at the same time. It made me think who has my identity details to activate the app on another phone?

The dev team really needs to change this and say “due to new update we need to reactivate the device/ re-register”

Also when are you building a UI that make use of the full Screen on an iPhoneXS Max. Right now it looks ugly and squared off with black borders at the top blocking time, network signal and battery details. 

One more suggestion - can we please see our VPA address in the account summary given how popular UPI transactions have become these days, it frustrating to go to the UPI section to find it.",1,2019-07-26 03:34:17
"App is now almost unusable because of the mandatory pop up offers that you have to see, you cannot block these pop up and you cannot even even access your bank statement without seeing them first and saying no to them, they occur everytime you login and the customer care says they cannot do anything about them, if the bank forces customers to see offers they don't want then customers will move out to a different bank, icici should realize that",1,2021-11-04 07:20:22
"I was using app from many years, updates and fixes are improving the user experience and also making banking easy. Few areas I feel needs improvement like,

1. login screen is taking a min to load as link to UPI on top right is killing/taking more time to load.
2. Scheduled Fund transfer are not displayed in mobile app.",4,2020-01-27 10:55:22
"The app has seen recent changes to the interface, which while welcome don’t compensate for the many glitches that exist. I have had enough struggles trying to toggle back from pages where the back button disappears; app doesn’t allow you to paste connection number when paying gas bills, inadvertently takes you to bottom of page automatically just as you try to paste it. These are just few of the issues that need to be rectified.",2,2021-06-02 16:43:35
"It keeps asking me to verify the account. Once that is done, I need to create a new pin every time and then it asks me to open a new account. For god sake I already have one and I need to perform my transactions. What is the point of having a mobile app when I cannot access net banking.  Completely nonsense. Can’t expect this from a firm like icici. Highly disappointed. And yes, It has been more than 6 months this app is not working. I need to use my laptop every time a transaction needs to be performed. So inconvenient. Have been with icici since 2004 and worst experience ever.",1,2020-06-02 08:45:57
"This app acts like a malicious software by hijacking the user actions. For example, it will automatically create a iwish account even if you are only checking out the product. It will automatically pre-select insurance while transferring funds. If you are in rush and forget to uncheck it, you have bought yourself an insurance policy without any confirmation. App will keep spamming about things to buy and in almost every action, it will pre-select some product. So if you are not careful while using this app, you will buy bunch of services without realising.",2,2019-10-05 07:38:17

I installed the app because i heard it is giving good cashbacks. But after installing had problem to link bank account. After some tweaks linked my bank account but later was unable to send money using UPI. It only showed you have done 1 payment earlier and does absolutely nothing after that. I haven’t made even 1 payment in my life using your app and now i want to close my account. Waste app. Don’t know how come this app has so high ratings.

"It’s a very usable app but there are glitches, the updated one needs a double take while entering the payee, there is difficulty in retaining transaction history, so this has to be manually done after each transaction. Simple things, which the bank should just do, but careless. See how google pay keeps the transactions… for ever, easily accessed. And it hangs.. probably 3 stars really.",4,2021-10-07 04:02:40
The creators made one of the smoothest app and very intuitive. However there is one inconvenience I think everyone must have been experiencing. Those who have Dmat account also their Dmat account statement and savings account statement is shown in the same list which is very confusing.

As I received a credit card from ICICI, as per recommendation have downloaded the app in my iPhone...and activated through as per app instructions and created login pin for app. After I login, it shows only a screen saying choose a product to apply...from here nothing to do except apply for a product...

It’s a pathetic first impression and never had such experience with any other banking or payment apps...with this kind of apps not sure how they compete with others... GROW UP ICICI",1,2020-12-18 06:40:07

"Why do I need to pay to talk to customer care and listen to your stupid ads by paying?
1st of all need to listen to “This is a chargeable call” in 2 languages
Then Amitabh bacchan will repeat corona msg
Then ICICI has a voice recognition menu which doesn’t recognize voice
Then you listen to their personal loan ads and other promotions while you are paying for this call
Finally when you are connected you need to input bank account number
1 sec delay in input and call gets disconnected by IVR

Repeat  this process 2-3 times

Finally when you are connected customer care executive will put you on hold.
And your balance becomes zero and call gets disconnected 

20 Rs wasted on listening to your stupid promotions.
And query remains same.

Its unethical to force customers to pay to talk to customer care
And most unethical is to force people to pay to listen to your promotions.",1,2020-12-15 12:38:59

Add a payee list for fund transfer from iMobile or Web app. The added payee gets reflected in both iMobile and Web. Now delete the payee list either from web or iMobile.

The App is great and absolutely the best banking mobile app but there are some performance issues which needs to be sorted out. One such performance issue that I had faced was that the app is taking too much time to launch either the touchID or the PIN at the home page of the app and thus I’m able to login only after 30-40 sec after it being launched. So request to rectify this issue.,4,2019-07-03 16:33:53
"Its so good that one cannot list all of it at once. 

Mostly the security is fantastic comprising OTP and grid card security.

I honestly believe its safe. 

I feel safe cos its not easy to transfer funds without the grid information - and that of course one needs to keep secret. Never share it with anyone. 

Now if one gives out the information to others comprising information of the grid or the OTP,  its like handing over the keys to the lock... then obviously the person gullible enough to handover the information is at fault (or charitable?!!)

Well this is the most important aspect of a banking app. Apart from that this is a pretty easy one - smooth and intuitive. 

Well deserved Five stars.",5,2018-01-06 05:58:17

Constantly lagging. Terrible interface. How about you pay people to actually design the application, not garbage old ports.

"A major drawback of the app is that it doesn't work on wifi especially if we want to login to pur account on this app as it requires a mobile data connection. My sim card slot is not working which has involved a cost equivalent to a new iphone. I use my phone over wifi all the time at home and in office. I want to login on this app but it doesnt allow to login on a wifi network. 

   Rest all other banks allow to login and use their bank applications on wifi. But this is a very poor drawback of icici bank app. Just because i could not login, i have stopped using my icici bank account and icici credit card for online purchases and transactions because i can't manage my icici bank account and credit card usage on this application... 

icici needs to work on this. Else customers will start switching to other banks due to such silly reasons.

You can verify this by opening some section of the app, say loans and within a few hours you receive a call from ICICI asking about your interest in a loan since you accessed that section in the app.

For testing purpose try to click on the options or links available on ICICI bank Apps after logging with your login credentials and try to return back by clicking Back Arrow go to previous page.

I’m using 6S. Because of this issue I reported as 3 star other wise it’s a 5 star app.",3,2018-12-31 04:58:59
"I have very great experience using iMobile app as it is very easy and fast to make any transaction and to know the status of application and outstandings, analytics, can easily start SIP, etc., whatever we need that’s there in the app. Wonderful design and user friendly interface. A big thanks to the ICICI Bank. Keep rocking.",5,2021-07-01 01:54:21
"I am trying to login my icici account but I can’t do that because of the message verification as the iPad is wifi only.

You can use an alternative method of sending the verification link on email which will redirect it to the icici bank login or send an OTP on email or phone number.",5,2021-02-06 01:24:41
"Earlier the app was good there was no problem in it now sometime error occurred like please try again later , something went wrong , you don’t have access . I was like really . and earlier we can call to customer care with the issue directly with the app now they provide the number which is chargeable and does not matter if you Have unlimited calls package or not. 

Great improvement ICICI team",3,2020-08-09 15:31:52
"Paid Bill through bill service.
After desuction it gave option to check transation status. I tried to check with transaction number but it says no such transaction. Then i tried to raise a query.
I filled in all details with transaction number then it says page cant be available please reach out to administrator. What a frustrating service. Please dont use ICICI mobile app for extra featurs. Its a risk.
Other instance : applied for IPO using UPI id of ICICI but transaction couldnt get completed because ICICI didnt clear payment and IPO date was over. From 20 days complaint not resolved.",1,2019-10-23 17:31:07
"The app in general is really really good. It does everything that you, would usually either have to go to a bank or login to the website. I honestly dont remember the last time i did any of those. 

However, the developers are slow at optimising the app for newer phones with full screens or notches. I have iphone xs, and the app is not optimised for it. It worked seamlessly on my older iphone.",4,2019-06-12 07:40:32
"Before the recent update the app was technically best but after update i am getting a pop up that my internet connection is offline. All other apps are working well except this app. I am unable to login , have checked connection again and again , have restarted my phone twice , done every possible thing but still haven’t got my verification message. 😏",4,2018-11-14 04:53:59
"Honestly, I’ve not been a fan of the old UI of the app. It basically look very bad, but after the latest update I’m loving the user interface. I couldn’t see my credit card details(balance) and wanted features to do other banking stuff, but now it’s possible. I appreciate the development team behind the update. Hoping to have a seamless experience with the app.",4,2018-06-07 19:30:22
"Extremely happy with the app and i use it daily. The four stars is due to the following feedback. 

The scan to pay option on iPhone wherein you can access a bouquet of UPI payment apps through a swipe up from Home Screen even in screen locked condition is really
convenient for making fast UPI payments. Once the iMobile app is selected for making the payment, Touch ID is used for authentication and unlocking the phone. However, iMobile app still seeks Touch ID authentication a second time to access the app which slows down the payment process. 
I think it can be avoided to hasten the UPI payment procedure and make it more smooth. 

Regards",4,2022-01-07 02:14:44
"I found app layout, User interface is different for different users. Is this correct. I have a special savings accounts with ICICI along with two credit cards.

"Inspite being the one of the best app for Banking, I truly think three major improvements
1. Refresh option for Credit cards so that in case we want to review the balance after payment or refund.
2. Pocket card can be added back as earlier.
3. If the speed of login could be increased, I mean why not try to make this fastest Banking App.. 👍",4,2020-04-19 04:31:24
"I really don’t understand that you had updated the app for betterment or made it worst to operate.

"The biggest problem with this app is you need to enter your password every time you want to login. All apps these days have Touch ID enabled for login and this app is years behind. It gave me an option to setup the Touch ID when I signed in the first time but after that every time I login I don’t get the option to use Touch ID.
I sent a mail about this to the email given in the app but as expected they have not replied. 
I would suggest people to give this a miss since it’s manually entering a password every time is extremely inconvenient.",1,2018-06-09 07:48:29

Filled the details many times and every time OTP comes but cannot fill it anywhere.  Can anything be more absurd than this?  I want to deregister my account but I have no option to do this. That is, you cannot use the account or close it.  Seriously, iMobile pay’s developer should died in minimum water.",1,2021-09-24 15:40:41
"For whoever thought it was a good idea that rather than login option on the app. Or! Simple both login via ID or Mobile. Was a good idea to make sure we login via mobile without streastesting of checking a fail percentile. Is a colossal wierdo.

"Just because we browse through the products in the iMobile application we receive calls immediately that you are interested in these product. We will help you with buying this product. For example if I browse the InstaSIP, or credit card, we receive these calls. This is annoying. First of all why to track my app usage patterns by the bank. I have been a customer of ICICI since 17 years. Have never been frustrated this much on the bank",1,2020-12-04 16:52:06
"Do not install this application, After installation there is no use of this app. You can not see your statement in this as there will be always error its not properly work, application has many features but all are useless unless you only see your account balance once when you trying to login 20 times or more. 

Third class and third quality app. Totally useless. Its shame on you ICICI.

Great app to use if you are able to login and validate your mobile number. The validation constantly fails for mobile numbers registered in China for NRI’s. I have reported multiple instances of this issue and it’s frustrating when technical support comes back stating its a handset issue. Handset changed and same old story. The developers need to include a +86 prefix for China users. Pointless advertising this APP for NRI’s when you don’t support all regions equally.,3,2019-07-04 13:12:49
I opened my account after seeing this app on a friend’s mobile. Easily one the best app that harness true power of mobile platforms. And still they are improving this. My only suggestion is if they can make this app more fluid. Still one of the best in business.,5,2021-04-16 13:37:58

I have regularly used this app for a long time. Overall satisfied. However the funds transfer feature does not allow decimals on iOS. It is allowed to make a credit card payment.

The fun starts when I use my WiFi. The app refuses to login on Wifi. Also it has become a standard norm (i believe for the ICICI) not to allow the net banking between 11:00PM to 3::00AM.

In your app if you unlock the PayLater feature then show that notification with 3 options: 'I' interested', 'i'm not interested' and 'Remind me Later' but here we have only two options 1st and 3rd, it's pathetic.

Second problem, every time that app shows notification count 1 after that latest update.

The UI is good. But UX is bad. Overall the experience remains pathetic and the app continues to be very unstable. Its much easier to transact through the mobile version of website.

And if the issue for a million Airtel user, will they ask all to check with the Airtel.

Vey bad to know that ICICI does not take responsibility for their own app. And they should collaborate with Airtel to sort out the issue .

Hope ICICI has started to loose it lead",1,2018-09-05 12:24:39

Because first you give the support and then with no notice now i am not able to use it.,1,2020-01-17 15:22:16
For no rhyme or reason I now need to verify again just because you guys have made an update to the app. And it doesn’t let me verify coz it says that the server is busy.

I’ve faced repeated issues whenever the app is updated. It resulted in its non-availability for days together.

I think ICICI forgot that their customer wants banking services, not useless offers.",1,2018-08-25 11:47:16

I installed iMobile only to recharge my ICICI fast tag which was given to me by my car dealer by default. I thought my life would be easy if I installed icici mobile app even though I don’t have an account with ICICI. I added my other bank account as UPI and got new VPA allotted but now neither can I recharge my fastag and neither can I deregister or delete the account number vpa,1,2021-09-21 17:20:47
